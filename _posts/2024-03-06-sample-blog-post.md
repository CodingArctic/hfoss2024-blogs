For my contribution, I decided to create this website and post this sample blog post. I decided to do this because I wanted to help provide a blogging platform for SJ to allow the students of HFOSS to have a place to submit their blog posts for the last half of the semester.

This contents of this blog post aims to achieve several things:
- Provide a tutorial explaining some of the basics of how this blog works to HFOSS students who will be adding posts to it
- Act as a template that can be duplicated to help kickstart the writing of new blog posts, or demonstrate some basic markdown syntax
- Demonstrate what a well-written, detailed blog post looks like. (That said this post will probably be longer than is expected for the actual HFOSS assignments because it may contain a lot of tutorial content) 
- Document how this blog was set up for future HFOSS TA's or FOSSRIT admins

## What is this site
<!-- begin jekyll-provided content here - TODO: need to adapt this -->
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
