## Introduction to the Community 

The community I chose came from the recommended list of communities that I found through a link in the CHAOSS presentation
slides. I am relatively new to contributing to FOSS communities, so I wanted to find something that would get me familiar 
with contributing for the first time as my bug fix. 

The community I chose was [Wincuts](https://github.com/LyubomirT/wincuts)  It is a relatively very new FOSS project that
is looking for more contributers. The software is in charge of setting up and managing custom keyboard shortcuts. The
primary languages that the software is coded in are python,HTML, and CSS. The main contributer of this community is 
LyubomirT. He was very welcoming when I asked to be assigned and stressed that I was new to contributing. This made
me even more willing to contribute to this community. 

From the Comm Arch presentations good communities have good documentation, contributing guidelines, and a welcoming 
community. I chose this community because the languages were semi familiar to me, as my specialty is low level languages
with some experience in python. 

## The Issue

So I reached out and was assigned the issue relating to moving icons to a directory and relinking them.
