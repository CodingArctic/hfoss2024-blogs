## Autogen
### What The Project Is:
**AutoGen** is a Microsoft framework for agenic AI, built to simplify building a complex multi-agent conversation system into creating modular reusable agents and their interactions.It can be found here https://github.com/microsoft/autogen. Microsoft claims this tool results in a 4x reduction in coding effort. Below is a diagram from a Microsoft blog post that shows this type of conversation model:

However, I didn’t actually get involved with the LLM part of this product. **My bugfix was on the website presence found [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/).** This website acts as a central hub for Autogen news, documentation, blogs, and examples. 

### Why I Picked It:
**I picked this project because** I found an open issue on http://goodfirstissues.com/ that aligned with my skillset (web development). Looking further into it, I saw that it was a very active project and I knew that my conversations with the community would be professional since it’s managed by Microsoft.  

### How My Comm Arch Experience Helped Choose A Community:

**My CommArch experience** made me pay attention to the distribution of contributors, quality of documentation, and overall activity of the community. Autogen doesn’t rely on one contributor and has small contributors as well as “drive-bys”. It also has organized and extensive documentation and increasing levels of activity. From this information, I decided that Autogen is a stable community to contribute to. 

## Contributing
### What resources Were Already Available:
Autogen has lots of **user resources** [here] (https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Getting-Started) and a contributor guide [here] (https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/contributor-guide).  It uses the Microsoft open source [Code of Conduct] (https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/) and the github lists a Creative Commons Public License and an MIT liscense.

## The Issue
### How I Picked My Issue And What It Was:
**I chose issue  #2053** which I found from its “good first issue” label. It was theoretically a quick fix and within my skillset as it was just a CSS issue. The issue was posted 3 weeks ago (as of writing this) by Jack Gerrits, a software engineer at Microsoft working on AutoGen. It was described as “on the website home page the icons are off center” and provided this screenshot:

### How I Went About Pursuing It (And The Challenges Therein): 
**First**, I commented on the issue, saying that I would like to work on it. This way, no one else would try to do it at the same time as me. I attempted to follow the quickstart guide to start working on the bug, but I kept running into problems in the Command Line with pip, AKA the package installer for Python. I decided it was unnecessary to go through the process of downloading everything to test the issue locally since I was able to test the solution with the Firefox Inspector tool anyway. I played with the CSS rules and **found a solution that didn’t require changing the site’s grid-flex hierarchy**.

## Success!
I created a fork of the project with my fix and made a pull request on **03/19/24**. Later the same day, I was invited to the repo and my pull request was **accepted and merged** into the main branch by Jack Gerrits.
