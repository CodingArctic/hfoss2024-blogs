## Autogen
*AutoGen* is a Microsoft framework for agenic AI, built to simplify building a complex multi-agent conversation system into creating modular reusable agents and their interactions.It can be found here https://github.com/microsoft/autogen. Microsoft claims this tool results in a 4x reduction in coding effort. Below is a diagram from a Microsoft blog post that shows this type of conversation model.

However, I didn’t actually get involved with the LLM part of this product. *My bugfix was on the website presence found here https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/.* This website acts as a central hub for Autogen news, documentation, blogs, and examples. 

*I picked this project because* I found an open issue on http://goodfirstissues.com/ that aligned with my skillset (web development). Looking further into it, I saw that it was a very active project and I knew that my conversations with the community would be professional since it’s managed by Microsoft.
